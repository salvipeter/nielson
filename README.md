# Nielson's 6-parameter G1 patch

Based on Nielson's [classic paper](https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780898712063):

G. M. Nielson, A transfinite, visually continuous, triangular interpolant. In: *Geometric
Modeling: Algorithms and New Trends*, pp. 235-246, 1987.

Uses my [libgeom](http://github.com/salvipeter/libgeom/) library.

Fullness (symmetric version of the α/β tension parameters in the paper) can also be set.

There is a function for evaluating the transfinite patch with
arbitrary continuous boundary constraints, as well.
